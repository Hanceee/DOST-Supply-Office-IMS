System Flow:
The system flow describes how users interact with the DOST Supply Office Information Management System. Users can register and log in to the system to access various functionalities. They can manage suppliers by adding, updating, or deleting supplier information. Users can also manage categories by adding new categories. When adding a supplier, users can select categories from the existing ones inputted in the category management. Users can rate suppliers based on predefined criteria, calculate average ratings, and provide comments. The system allows users to search for suppliers based on different criteria and view their details. Additionally, users can generate supplier reports that include supplier information, average ratings, total ratings, and comments, and print them if needed. User authentication ensures secure access to the system.

Database Schema:
The database schema consists of four main tables: Supplier, Rating, Category, and User. The Supplier table stores supplier information such as name, address, contact details, email, average rating, category ID, date of the last rating, total number of ratings, and comments. The Rating table stores ratings for each supplier, including criteria such as quality, delivery, pricing, customer service, reliability, and comments.
